You will need to install **pyautogui** to make the bot run
```
pip install pyautogui
```
Use this link **chrome://dino/** to access the game even when you have internet (*use chrome*).

# Theory
I capture a screenshot every frame to look for obstacles to avoid.

There are 2 search ranges to find obstacles:

1- To look for the ground obstacles (**Cactus**).

2- To look for the upper obstacles (**Birds**).

#### How to identify obstacle?
An obstacle is connsidered any pixel in the search area that is different than the background colour.
If the bot finds an obstacle it uses the python **keyboard** library to press space and let the Dino jump.

The high score so far is **14490**.

Any recommendations are welcomed
